Hello, World!

Tonight marks the beginning of my blog. It'll be centered around my activities and the cool things I do day to day. Not only will it be a repository of interesting content, the mere presence of a public-facing archive of my works and thoughts will hopefully spur me onto creating interesting things. 

The title I've chosen is "Locutus." In latin, it means "having been said," since it's the perfect passive participle of loquor. This word is one of the reasons I love latin so much. It has this air to it - when I hear or say it, I think of discussions between members of some illustrious junto in a dusty, candle-lit library, or perhaps a speech being delivered in the forum at the dawn of the new millenium. In a word, it captures the essence of this website.

These words, having been said.

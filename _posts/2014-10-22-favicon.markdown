Today, in addition to messing with my custom apex domain name (that's an ongoing struggle, and I'll post about that when I'm satisfied with it), I also created a favicon for the site. It actually represents some interesting math, which I'll also try to explain.

##MATHEMATICS
The original image is of the julia set of a third-degree polynomial with one quaternion degree. I like to think of the two complementary sets we're dealing with, the Julia and Fatou sets, as they relate to fixed- or stationary-points on functions. I won't go into too much depth here, since this isn't meant to be a math post, but further reading can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) and [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JuliaSet.html), and I'll include some code snippets that you can run to see a fixed-point attractor in action.

<!--preview-->

A function has a fixed point attractor if repeated iterations of that function converge to a point. For example, if you repeatedly iterate cos(), you'll see the values converging to approximately 0.72. I think this is one of the coolest things I've come across in mathematics, and it is surprisingly fundamental. Fixed-point theorems pop up all over the place, especially topology and functional analysis, like the [Banach Fixed-Point Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem).

--haskell
--functional languages are great for math-y stuff

ntimesf f n x = foldr (.) id (replicate n f) x
ntimesf cos 20 3.14

--the fixed point for cos() should be approximately 0.72
--this returns 0.7389377574088228 !
{% endhighlight %}

If you want a visual of what this is doing, this image from wikipedia helped me:

![I should generate an animated one!]({{ site.url }}/assets/cos_fixed_point.png){:.foo width="500"}

##GRAPHICS
This is the favicon:

![Locutus' Icon]({{ site.url }}/assets/julia-red-orange.png){:.foo width="500"}

*Ain't she beautiful?*

I generated it from this image, which I found in some math wallpapers thread ages ago:

![The original image]({{ site.url }}/assets/julia_original.jpg){:.foo width="500"}

The resolution isn't that great, so I used [this site](http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg) to convert it to a vector file format:

![Vectorized images are a godsend]({{ site.url }}/assets/julia.svg){:.foo width="500"}

*This actually is a great wallpaper now!*

Then, I processed it in GIMP until I got something that I was happy with. That step was fairly straightforward; the thing of note is that the red color is actually from the official git logo, which is apt, since I'm using github to host and manage this blog. Finally, I used [this site](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate the complete favicon package, and it works as expected. I even stuck a shortcut on the homescreen of my Nexus 5 (you should too, hint hint).

I also added in the little watermarks to the side of the post titles, which I created using inkscape and arduously debugged until they displayed properly. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm a big fan of vector graphics formats. I still have to get everything to render properly on mobile; the problem is that images are too wide, but I'll mess with all of that later.

And people say vector calculus isn't relevant in the real world! Evidently, not only can pure math generate some very beautiful images, with a little bit of application, it can also store and manipulate those images in the real world beautifully.

This week, I resolved to register for a couple graduate classes for the coming fall semester. One of them is E E 381V, which is a topics course that focuses on convex optimization. In anticipation of getting *absolutely* bear-mauled, my friend (who is also planning to take the class with me) and I have started preparing by reading through Boyd's book and doing the problem sets.

I don't think I've ever been hooked like this before. For a long time, going to grad school was an aspiration of mine, but while I could imagine myself there, I could never see the path that would bring me to that point, or even what I would be doing when and if I got there. My interests are primarily math and computer science, but I never really had a topic reel me in completely. You hear people talk about getting up in the morning, doing research, then going back to sleep and starting all over again the next day, but while I really like math, especially algebra and complex analysis, I never had it consume me. Algebra is interesting and mind-expanding, but I could never shake the feeling that it was entirely artificial even if profound, and as a result I never really proved anything significant independently. 

This week, that all changed. I have completely fallen for this stuff. It's incredible. As someone who has some sort of perspective-altering experience at least once a month, this stuff is *incredible*. I haven't even gotten to the really powerful, interesting bits - the meat of convex optimization - and already I'm hooked. I know what the feeling is like now. I know what I would study in grad school. In fact, I know that grad school is once again an option; I had dismissed it off-hand earlier and planned to go directly into the workforce, but this weeknd has forced me to reconsider. 

Even further, I think I know now why people drop out. I don't want to take courses and worry about exams and fawn over my 4.0 as if it's a smattering of embers in a mote of kindling while a heavy gale blows. I don't want to do three-round interviews with ten companies half a year before possibly working for them. This year, I took six math classes (probably still not enough), worked part time, recruited, joined clubs, explored a bunch of industries, set up exit opportunities - I did a lot of things, but I don't think any of them really made me happy. Next year, starting now, I'm just going to study. 

This is like a return to childhood for me. When I didn't have to worry about class, or work, or my future, or any of that. When I would just hole up with a book - some days my copy of Philip's Atlas of the Universe, other days random histories, and still others classics like Moby Dick and Siddhartha. It's never felt so good to get back to your roots.

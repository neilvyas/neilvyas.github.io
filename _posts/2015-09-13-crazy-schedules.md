Until December, my life is going to be the most hectic it will probably ever be. This semester, I am
 taking three graduate classes and one of the last math classes, as well as continuing to work almost 
15 hours a week. Insanity isn't even the half of it, but I think if I can survive it, this will be 
one of the most rewarding experiences I've had.

My goals are to end December with a better understanding of modeling real-world problems with formal 
machinery, and then using the methods I learn to solve them efficiently and cleverly. Today, there are 
many important problems facing us, including energy and infrastructure security, climate change, and 
loss of biodiversity, and I want to be able to make the best contribution to tackling these issues 
that I can.

All three of my graduate classes overlap nicely, and this overlap is great for picking out deeper 
patterns in the material we cover. I'm also taking algebra because I need to take a math class every 
semester or I'll lose it, and surprisingly, some of the stuff we've covered has already popped up in 
some of my convex optimization homeworks.

I got really lucky with my professors, since not only are they awesome, they also seem to know each 
other fairly well; for example, Dr. Price and Dr. Caramanis are both doing the "sketching and learning" 
formal probability seminars this semester.

**CS 388R: Randomized Algorithms**   
*Graduate, with Dr. Eric Price*

I've never taken a CS course before, although this is basically a math class so it's been ok so far.
The lectures are incredibly, mind-bendingly dense, and Dr. Price is one of the best lecturers I've 
had the privilege of having. He's one of the few professors who *will* wait for minutes until someone 
comes up with an approach to a problem he's presented, and furthermore he's the only one I've had 
who's managed to seamlessly weave whatever a student suggests into his lecture.

The material is really interesting, especially when we get problems like "given a biased coin with 
heads probability $$p$$, how many flips do you need to determine $$p$$ to $$\epsilon$$ error with probability 
$$1 - \delta$$?" 

**EE 381K: Convex Optimization**    
*Graduate, with Dr. Constantine Caramanis*

I've posted about how much I liked this material before, and it's gotten even better since a colleague 
and I have been doing optimization problems at work (mostly linear programming, although recently the 
focus has been understanding integer programming).

The class is fun, and I especially like that, unlike Boyd, Dr. Caramanis is making an effort to have us 
program and test methods while learning the theory. For convenience, I'm keeping my assignments on my 
github, so you can check them out [here](http://github.com/neilvyas/convexOptimization).

**EE 381J: Probability and Stochastic Processes**  
*Graduate, with Dr. Gustavo de Veciana*

I think understanding probability really well will be one of the most important things I must come away 
with after my years at UT. Thus, I'm going to try and take a probability class every semester. This one 
in particular is fun because it's in engineering, which means that we briefly went over the formalization 
of probability, but will be focusing on modeling and applications. Plus, Dr. de Veciana is really 
entertaining.

**M373K: Algebra**      
*Undergraduate, with Dr. Sean Keel*

This course caused a little bit of a firestorm over the summer; long story short, Dr. Keel was expecting 
people to come to six hours of lecture a week, and assigns homework accordingly. We're using Artin, which 
is cool because it was the first real math book I ever tried to read, but is also kind of an odd choce.

The amount of homework assigned is nuts, and the level of rigor required is over-much, in my junior 
opinion, so so far, this class has been a huge headache.

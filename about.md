This blog is a collection of things that I find interesting, primarily math and cs related, with 
the occasional personal narrative. I'm a pure math major at The University of Texas at Austin, with
significant interest in EECS. My interests include 

- [Robust Optimization](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~dbbrown/bio/papers/bertsimas_brown_caramanis_11.pdf)  
- [Decision Making Under Uncertainty](https://mitpress.mit.edu/decision-making-under-uncertainty)  
- [Design and Analysis of Algorithms, especially Probababalistic Ones](http://www.immorlica.com/randAlg/Karp91.pdf)  
- [Complex Analysis](http://www.fing.edu.uy/~cerminar/Complex_Analysis.pdf)  
- [Probability and Stochastic Processes](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math144_1994/probability.pdf)  
- [Model Uncertainty and Robustness](http://web.stanford.edu/~cy10/public/mrobust/Model_Robustness.pdf)  
- [Machine Learning](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)  
- [Imbalanced Classification](http://www.icmc.usp.br/~mcmonard/public/laptec2002.pdf)  
- [Causal Inference](http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf)  

I'm a perennial data science intern at [Civitas Learning](http://www.civitaslearning.com/) here in Austin, working mainly on causal inference, scheduling and optimization, feature extraction and evaluation, and clustering. For Summer 2016 I am an intern on the Search Recommendations team at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com) in San Francisco.

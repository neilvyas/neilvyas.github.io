Hello! 
======

I'm **Neil Vyas**, a junior at UT Austin, where I study math, especially probability and stochastic
processes, and do some CS and programming on the side. One of my main interests is data science,
especially causality, data modeling, and (simple, interpretable) machine learning.

In the past, I've worked as a data science intern in Austin as well as on the ads autobidding team
at Yelp, which was a really interesting and out-of-the-ordinary role. It's been fun! Someday, I'll be a
good academic and do some research.

For fun, I enjoy reading and road biking. For productivity, I'm a fan of the terminal warrior
aesthetic and use `vim` and `tmux` extensively. Since I do a lot of mathematics, I've also iterated
my `LaTeX` setup enough to be able to live-`tex` notes and such. You can find my awfully-maintained
dotfiles and `LaTeX` setup on my github! Some people seem to like the `.cls` files in particular.

You can check out my [blog](blog.html) from the navbar. Someday, I'll write something interesting.
Someday too I'll put a cool `elm` demo in here, or whatever. If you're reading this, me, you can do
this!

A collection of things, and relationships between things, that I find interesting. I study pure math
but have significant interest in CS, data science, education, and finance, particularly price
discovery.

I've worked as a data science intern at Civitas Learning in Austin and as a engineering intern on the
Ads Autobidding team at Yelp in San Francisco. I'm also part of UT's computational finance org, Texas
UCF, which has been the one club membership that I've really valued over the years. My education has
been basically all math classes with some forays into applications through CS and EE. Someday, I'll be
a good academic and do some research. 

For fun, I enjoy reading and road biking (I have a wonderful white CAAD8). For productivity, I'm a
fan of the terminal warrior aesthetic and use `vim` and `tmux` extensively. Since I do a lot of
mathematics, I've also iterated my `LaTeX` setup enough to be able to live-`tex` notes and such.

Today's theory tidbit of the day (and possibly tomorrow's, and the day after's...):

$$ \lim_n \int f_n d\mu = \int f d\mu, \qquad f_n \nearrow f,$$

since math is all about `(i)` breaking things apart and putting them back together again and `(ii)`
flipping the order of two things, and currently `(a)` I'm doing a lot of measure theory, `(b)` this
statement invokes both `(i)` and `(ii)`, and `(c)` it's a very simple one-liner that turns out to be
extremely useful but isn't as much of a `meme` as Bayes' Theorem.
